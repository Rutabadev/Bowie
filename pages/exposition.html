                    <p class="abstract">Many people were hoping that if the Democrats won control of Congress they would reverse the online gambling ban, but experts doubt they will even try or that if they do that the will be successful. Once the bill was passed and signed into law by the president, it became much harder to reverse the law. The democrats would need to bring up the law and get it to a vote, then after the vote passed it needs to go to the president for his signature. The problem with this is that the current president is the one who signed the bill into law in the first place.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another problem is because the gambling ban was attached to another bill, it means that to reverse the law the entire bill needs to be reversed, but the other part of the bill is for an increase in port security, so any congressmen who recommends reversing this law, will be going on record as trying to reverse the increase in port security.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because of this trying to get the law reversed could ruin a congressman’s chances of ever getting elected to public office again for the rest of their lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It is more likely that it will have to wait till the end of George Bushes term in office and then get an amendment to the law that reverses only gambling ban part of the law.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">More and more people are opting to live the herbal life: moving away from chemicals and scientific medicines, and taking traditional herbs to do everything from losing weight to relieving pain. They are often remedies that have been used in communities for hundreds or even thousands of years, and have now been taken for sale worldwide because of the people’s claims about their powers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The last few decades have seen an explosion in the popularity of herbs and alternative medicine in general, as people increasingly seek miracle cures that can help them when their doctor or regular pharmacy cannot. The connection to traditional communities also appeals to those who want to go back to a more spiritual, myth-based way of life, instead of testing everything in a laboratory. It is also often believed that using herbs instead of chemicals can avoid the potential side effects of putting lots of synthetic substances into the body.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Many people, however, say that herbal remedies are just a load of mumbo-jumbo, designed to sell gullible people some useless plants at premium prices. When the herbs do have some effect, it is put down to them being a placebo. This means that the act of taking the herb that makes you feel like you should feel better, and so you do, even if there was nothing in the herb itself to make that happen.</p>

                <p>Most linear thinkers have a great deal of difficulty even comprehending why on earth someone in their “right mind” would be interested in visiting a planet called “IT”. Not being a linear thinker with an investment in the “right” answer, I didn’t give a hoot. After all, what does one (who walks on water & listens to miffed mortals all day long) do for a frigging night off, now I ask you?</p>
